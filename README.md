# F1MVP
A 2021 Formula One season stats website for the Fomula One newcomer.

# Description
The 2021 Formula One season was one to remember. With the popularity of the sport on the rise, I wanted to create a page for newcomers to reference for all things related to the 2021 season before the start of the 2022 season.
